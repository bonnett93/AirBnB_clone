# # AirBnB clone - The console

Hello! in this repository we are developing the Airb&b clone by means of Python, let's start with this fascinating journey:

One of the first steps is to create the BaseModel Class, in which we use it through Json of the serialization and deserialization of the instances that we create with them.  

We create all the necessary classes to introduce and to handle the user's data like State, City, Place ect.

We create the unittes to confirm the outputs of the instances we create through our class.

# Description of files 
Jordan Bonnet and Julio C arenas contributed to the development of the Airb&B project.



 ## CONSOLE
Console.py is a command interpreter in which we can create different objects, the commands contained in this interpreter are:
> - do_EOF () : exit the program by typing Ctrl + d.
> - empty line () : an empty line + ENTER does not execute anything.
> - do_quit () : exits the program.
> - do_create () : creates a new instance of a specific class and saves it (in the JSON file).
> - do_show () : prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id.
> - do_destroy () : deletes an instance based on the class name and id.
> - do_all () : shows all instances that are located in the .json file based on the class name or not.
> - do_update () : update an instance based on the class name and ID by adding or updating an attribute
> -do_clear () : clears the console.



## MODELS FOLDER
	This folder contains all the moodulos of the class and of the folder called engine.


##  TEST
	This folder contains all tests that we develop for UNITTEST, in which the tests of each module are included.
